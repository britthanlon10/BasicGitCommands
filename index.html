      <h1>Basic Git Commands</h1>

      <h2>git add</h2>
      <p>
        Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives
        you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the
        official history.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>git branch</h2>
      <p>
        This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets
        you create isolated development enviornments within a single repository.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>git checkout</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisisons, git
        checkout is also the means to navigate existing brances. Combined with
        the basic Git commands, it's a way to work on a particular line of
        development.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>git clean</h2>
      <p>
        Removes unutracked files from the working directory. This is the logical
        counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked
        files.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>git clone</h2>
      <p>
        Creates a copy of an existing Git repsoitory. Cloning is the most common
        way for developers to obtain the basic workflow for all Git users.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>git commit</h2>
      <p>
        Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history.
        Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git
        users.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>git commit --amend</h2>
      <p>
        Passing the --amend flag to git commit lets you amend the most recent
        commit. This is very useful when you forget to stage a file or omit
        important information from the commit message.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>git config</h2>
      <p>
        A convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation.
        You'll typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git
        on a new development machine.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>git fetch</h2>
      <p>
        Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all offf
        its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate
        anything into your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect
        changes before merging them with your project.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>git init</h2>
      <p>
        Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under
        revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.

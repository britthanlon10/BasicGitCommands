    <h1>git add</h1>
    <p>Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.</p>

    <h1>git branch</h1>
    <p>This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development enviornments within a single repository.</p>

    <h1>git checkout</h1>
    <p>In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisisons, git checkout is also the means to navigate existing brances. Combined with the basic Git commands, it's a way to work on a particular line of development.</p>
    
    <h1>git clean</h1>
    <p>Removes unutracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked files.</p>
    
    <h1>git clone</h1>
    <p>Creates a copy of an existing Git repsoitory. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain the basic workflow for all Git users.</p>
    
    <h1>git commit</h1>
    <p>Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.</p>
    
    <h1>git commit --amend</h1>
    <p>Passing the --amend flag to git commit lets you amend the most recent commit. This is very useful when you forget to stage a file or omit important information from the commit message.</p>
    
    <h1>git config</h1>
    <p>A convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation. You'll typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git on a new development machine.</p>
    
    <h1>git fetch</h1>
    <p>Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all offf its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect changes before merging them with your project. </p>
    
    <h1>git init</h1>
    <p>Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.</p>
